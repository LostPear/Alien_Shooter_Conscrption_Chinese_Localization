<Icon=391,2>
Hey man! There's some crash on the bottom level 
of the base again. Go and check this out
while I am writing complaint
against these builders!


<2>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,5>
Good start, rookie!
Our engineer likes to play the "Big Boss".


<3>
Whoa, that's quite a hole,
I better go and tell the engineer!



<4>
Are you all crazy over there?!

<pause>
Where's the emergency lighter switch?


<5>
Oh my, and I've been told it's a quite base.

<6>
What a nice beast!

<pause>
Hey, stop biting!


<7>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,2>
Looks like I was wrong blaming the builders!
General evacuation! Time to get lost!

<pause>
Where are YOU going? 
Have'you seen the instruction?!
File- server is situated on this level, 
save or destroy the secret data!


<8>
Can't all the engineers be so much cowards...

<pause>
I'll try to reach the exit.

<9>
It was really strange of me to wait for help
from this engineer.
How do I unlock this...

<10>
Seems like control panel is there.
If I don't find the key,
the monsters will enjoy substantial launch. 



<10_1>
Shall I go and let the monsters eat me or 
shall I be tried by a military tribunal...
I better die as a hero! 

;************LEVEL 2************
<11>
Seems it was much more quiet inside.
Need to reach evacuation station.



<12>
Doesn't look like I can fly on this helicopter...


<13>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,3>
<SFX=115>
Is the whole group destroyed?!

...
Go to the main square! Faster!
we can't wait forever.



<14>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,5>
Private!
Follow me, my group needs reinforcement.
It's an order!

<15>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,5>
Where were you?!

<pause>
Take the explosive
and destroy those beasts holes.


<16>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,5>
Faster! We got time to clear off. 


<17>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,5>
Everybody to the locations!

<pause>
Private, go to the center of the hall
and bring me activation disk.
Cover him!



<18>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,5>
Not bad for the recruit.

<pause>
Field store is activated,
in case you want to get out alive,
replenish the ammunition load.
You can go now.



<19>
What a strange staff, was it really 
important to risk my life for it...


;************LEVEL 3************
<20>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,2>
Lucky you, not many people survived there.
Go to the General, he would like to meet
every survivor in person.


<21>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,0>
Hope you realise that the situation
on the battle- front isn't that good, 
we are loosing the cities one by one.
<pause>
If we don't initiate anything, the only 
creatures left on the Earth will be those 
beasts.


<22>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,2>
General, we got one more breakthrough
in sector 5E13, they need help!

<23>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,0>
Send sergeant Donaldson's 
division there immediately!

<pause>
Private, I am adding you to
Donaldson's division.
Move to the control point 
and pass this information.


<24>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,0>
Corporal, you can go!


<25>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,5>
Newbie!
Let's see you fighting.
Drop your gun and take this one,
hope it will keep you alive longer.



<26>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,5>
Sergeant is in barracks.
Go through the basement, 
the manhole is in the garage.


<27>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,5>
Sergeant Donaldson is upstairs in his 
room, you've been reported about.


<28>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,6>
Hope we're not late,
Follow me!


<29>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,6>
Oh no!
We'll go roundabout way.


<30>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,6>
To the position!
The helicopters protect acesses to the sector,
take the car and get rid of these beasts.
Execute!


;************LEVEL 4************
<31>
I'll try to go round, walking
would be less pleasant.


<32>
Great! Well, walking is my favorite 
from the childhood! 


<33>
Hope I am not late for the party,
need to hurry up!



;************LEVEL 5************
<5_1>
What is it behind this door? 
Why do they guard this place so heavy?
     

<34>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,5>
Private! Are you going to walk around 
and wait until we all die here?


<35>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,5>
To the position, 
the enemy is from the front!

<36>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,5>
Where were you? Donalson's guys are here already!
There should be ammunition on the power station,
take private Myers and run there quickly.  


<37>
What a place.
That coward stayed there not for nothing.


<38>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,3>
Sergeant Donaldson speaking, they have broken 
the defence through, all the communications 
channels are disabled.
Run to radio set and try to connect with the 
headquarters, if we got no reinforcement we'll 
loose that object!

 

<39>
Hope this junk works.


<40>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,4>
Request accepted. Reinforcement group will
arrive to the helipad.
Cover them.
 

<41>
That's strange, why reinforcement
team is landing here...   


<42>
Hope I'll be in time.


<43>
Thanks but no, I won't go back to this hell alone.
Where is this helipad!
 

<44>
Interesting terminal...
Great, that's my dream to get such!


<45>
Follow me, Donaldson's division is not far away!


<46>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,5>
He's the only one alive, kill him!


<47>
Wow, this access card gives me a chance!
I'll go and check what they keep in these bunkers.


<48>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,5>
Hey, let me wait here,
it's just half of the year till my discharge...

<50>
Looks like this bunker is neglected
for a long time already.
I' ll try to re-establish the power supply.


<51>
Didn't plan swimming for sure.


<52>
Here's power producing cabinet.


<53>
Let's try...

<54>
Seems like stabilizer has failed,
however the right wing is unblocked.
Hope there's repair cabinet over there...
 

<55>
That's what I need!

<56>
Blocked, so tired of these mysteries...


<57>
Here's the key.

<58>
Oh no! No short circuit please!



<59>
Power circuits have failed,
I' ll try to stop the process
of liquidation from the master terminal.


<60>
Great! Liquidation is irreversible,
time to get lost.


<61>
Never used the teleports,
anyways, have no other choice...


;************LEVEL 7************
<62>
Interesting place, I bet these are 
aliens' eggs.


<63>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,5>
Hey guys, look,
that's all they've sent us for reinforcement!
Where is your division, soldier?

<pause>
This teleport works in 
only one direction.
Let's go to the corporal, seems 
there's nobody to wait for help,
need to get away from here.


<64>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,5>
Come in, corporal is waiting for you.
 

<65>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,1>
Hey private, it's amazing you've survived.
Call me Jane.

<pause>
I think you're right, somebody wants to
cover up one's tracks, need to get out of here, 
otherwise we might end as Donaldson's division...
He was an excellent soldier. 

<pause>
I will revenge myself upon his death. Follow me!



<66>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,1>
Oh no! The entrance is blocked up.
Well, it's time for you to get 
acquainted with our tame doggie.
Go down through the caves, i am holding
the position!
Use walkie- talkie!
 
<67>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,3>
<SFX=115>
Good job, take this control panel
and don't be surprised. Until he wears
the collar- he's under our control. 

<68>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,3>
<SFX=115>
Bring him here!

<69>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,1>
Great doggie!
I've no idea who made this and what for,
but we wouldn't stay alive here without him.



<70>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,5>
Thanks, take it, I wouldn't survive without you.

;************LEVEL 8************
<71>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,1>
I've found the map of the caves in archived files.
Teleport should be somewhere here.
Let's go, hope it works.



<71_1>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,1>
Look! Monsters need friends!


<72>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,1>
What is that?
Circular defence!


<73>
There should be by-pass route!


<74>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,1>
Follow me, here's the way!


<75>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,1>
Teleport is here.
Clean the territory, I'll try to activate it.


<76>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,1>
Faster, I don't know how much energy we got.
Jump into teleport!


<77>
Jane, do you feel it?
The Earth is shaking under the feet!


<78>
No retreat!

;************LEVEL 9************
<79>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,1>
That was not easy.
Let's go, we need to find the headquarters of this 
base and sort everything out.


<80>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,5>
Here are the survivors from bunker. Alarm!


<81>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,1>
Unlucky start, to the battle!  


<82>
Bastards!

<83>
Jane needs help,
we need to find the way up!

<84>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,7>
They made me do this!

<pause>
Sure, I' ll tell you how to get upstairs,
take my access card.


<85>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,7>
Hey stop, there's no chance
for me to get out of here,
please, destroy everything we've created.


<pause>
Yeah, I know it's horrible!
The incubator is in the left wing of the base,
don't let them destroy the Earth.


<86>
The way is free, we need to move further.


<87>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,1>
The elevator is blocked,
try to bypass the guard from terminal side.


<88>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,1>
Faster, until they didn't come to their senses!


;************LEVEL 10************
<89>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,1>
General, what for?!
The whole humanity will die!



<90>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,0>
Jane, you're good soldier, but you'll never understand!
It's a pity our roads turn to different directions now!


<91>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,0>
Remind me, how many times you should have been 
dead already?
Sorry, but I got no time right now, hope my boys
will succeed in finishing what we have started!


<92>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,0>

You got not so much time left!
Save the gunshots, soldier!


<93>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,8>
I heard everything, but he said
that's the only way we can cope with 
invasion!

<pause>
Follow me, I know how to stop it.


<94>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,8>
I'll unblock the elevator from here,
cover me!


<95>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,8>
Ready. There are reactors in the basement,
blow them up and we'll be done with it.
Hurry up!
 


<96>
<Font=10>
<Icon=391,0>
You're here again.
Wanna stop me by yourself?
You know what?! 
With monsters army I am gonna rule the world!
