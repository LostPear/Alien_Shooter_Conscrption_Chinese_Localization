Health
Without it, life is far too short.
A high Health guarantees longer
life through damage absorption.
Increasing this raises your hit points. 

[712_1]
Strength
This is your general toughness and
determines how many objects you
can carry. Increasing this raises
your hit points.

[712_2]
Speed
Good for either charging into battle
or running away. Influences your
movement speed - these damn Aliens
will have it more difficult to
bite you in the neck.
 
[712_3]
Accuracy
To hit the broad side of an alien's
skull with any kind of gun, you'll
need plenty of this skill. 


[712_4]
Intelligence
The higher this is, the less like a
doorknob you are, the higher IQ, 
the better implants you can use.
...you will also get more paranoid
and you'll probably find French 
movies more interesting, but that's
a different story.

[712_5]
Armor Handling 
Can't hack the pain? Increasing this
skill increases the types of body
armor you can wear.

[712_5_surv]
Self Defence
These damn Aliens have a really hard
time hitting you. Your skin is so 
thick you could call it extra armor. 

[712_6]
Handguns
Pistols might be small, but they're
useful in tight situations. This skill
increases your ability to use 
handguns. 


[712_7]
Shotguns
For solutions that don't require a 
lot of subtlety, a shotgun is the
answer. This skill increases your
ability to use shotguns.

[712_8]
Submachine & Machine Guns
For anyone with bad aim, or that likes
to break lots of things really fast.
This skill increases your ability to
use submachine and machine guns.

[712_9]
Grenade & Rocket Launchers
One shot, lots of kills. This skill
increases your ability to use 
grenade and rocket launchers.

[712_10]
Flamethrowers & Energy Weapons
Good for giving things a deep-fried
coat. This skill increases your 
ability to use flamethrowers and power 
arms (lasers and the like).


[712_11]
Cash
Hopefully self-explanatory. Good for buying
more of what you need to beat things into 
a pulp.


[713_0]
Self-Treatment
You always enjoyed playing with yourself -
this skill enables you to heal yourself.
Your body will regenerate automatically,
just give it some time. 


[713_1]
Quick Learner
If you want your character to advance more
quickly, increase this, because it determines 
how fast you learn things and how fast you spot 
hidden items.


[713_2]
Economist
Some see it as "thievery." You see it as 
"proactive frugalness." A good Economist
will be able to scrounge cash in the strangest
of places.

[713_3]
Fast Shooter
As the name says you are a fast shooter.
No matter which weapon you use, your 
shooting frequency is perfect.

[713_4]
Night vision
Affects your ability to see in the dark
(without the aid of artificial light
sources).


[713_5]
Vampire
A skill that really sucks. With this
ability, your character can drain health
from enemies to add to yours.
Even Nosferatu couldn't do that better.

[713_6]
Hypnotist
Become a master of staring with psychotic
eyes. Let's you hypnotize and then control
the enemy. Weird stuff! 

[713_7]
Observer
Lets you spot hidden things, like secret places, 
hidden items, Jimmy Hoffa, and legroom on
airplanes.

[713_9]
Boxer
You are a professional boxer - not
like Mickey Rourke! In close combat you
kick serious ass!
